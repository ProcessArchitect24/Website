                <h2>Hi, I'm Madeline.</h2>
                <p>I've spent 6 years in property management. It started with keeping my mom's business alive—she was the broker-owner, and I did whatever needed to be done to keep things running.</p>
                <p>From there, I stepped into resident services. At one point, I was managing 800 doors by myself. It was chaos, but it forced me to figure out what actually works when you're stretched thin.</p>
                <p>I became the person our team turned to for systems, processes, and automations. If something could be streamlined, I found a way. Eventually, I stepped into the primary owner-facing role, leading 7 employees and overseeing 1,000 doors.</p>
                <p>That experience taught me something important: peace in property management is possible. But only if you have the right systems in place.</p>
                <p>Process Architect exists to help other operators build what I wish I'd had earlier—clear processes, working software, and a team that knows exactly what to do.</p>
